# AI Image Generation Comparison

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Disclosure: Outside of the uv setup and a few configuration bits and pieces, this app was generated using AI, in particular, Claude Sonnet. This was done as part of some other testing I was doing.

This is an application to test the responses of different AI image generation models to the same prompt, in particular with image generation. You can [see a sample of its output here](https://github.com/nicholasgriffintn/ai-image-generation-comparison/tree/main/data/25-nov).

To run the application, run the following command:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

The application will then be available at `http://localhost:8000`, it will look like this:
